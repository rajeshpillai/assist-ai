It’s Monday morning. Mini the cat notices his human forgot to feed him.

He tries knocking over the cereal box, but it doesn't work.

Then he drags the food bowl to the human’s bed and meows loudly.

Finally, the human wakes up groggy and laughs, saying, “Okay okay, breakfast coming up!”

Mini looks proud and victorious.
